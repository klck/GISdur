calcCorners is used for calculating the three missing corners from our plot 
using the coordinates of the given corner, orientation (bearing from north), 
declination (difference between magnetic and grid north, beeing in this case 
-1.48Â°) and the two length of the plot.

```{r}
calcCorners <- function(x.known, y.known, 
                        orientation, declination,
                        size.x, size.y) {
  alpha <- orientation - declination
  alpha270 <- alpha + 270
  alpha90 <- alpha + 90
  
  D2A <- triangle(alpha270, size.x)
  A2B <- triangle(alpha, size.y)
  B2C <- triangle(alpha90, size.x)
  
  
  Ax <- x.known + D2A[,1]
  Ay <- y.known + D2A[,2]
  Bx <- Ax + A2B[,1]
  By <- Ay + A2B[,2]
  Cx <- Bx + B2C[,1]
  Cy <- By + B2C[,2]
  Dx <- x.known
  Dy <- y.known
  Corners <- data.frame(A = list(x = Ax, y = Ay), B = list(x = Bx, 
  y = By), C = list(x = Cx, y = Cy), D = list(x = x.known, y = y.known))
  return(Corners)
```

calcCorners with our values leads to the following results:

```{r}
calcCorners(481054, 5645540, 9, -1.48, 48, 30)
```
